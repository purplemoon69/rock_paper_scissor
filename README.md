Aftermath Thoughts

This project was challenging, my first time making a script of code. 
The most difficult part was to understand the logic behind functions, use of properties, and how to combine everything to make one running function.
The best approach to understand these concepts is to carefully analyze each line of code by looking a well done script and explain it in plain english.
Then code the program again till I can completely understand the logic behind javascript, behind coding.
Coding is an interpretation of the human mind. They are both similar. It seems that humans tried and still trying to replicate the human mind through coding, encoding human behavior into scripts of code.
